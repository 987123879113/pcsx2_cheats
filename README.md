# pcsx2_cheats

Python 2 cheats use the `patchExtended` command which is exclusive to the P2IO fork of PCSX2. The `patchExtended` command allows for patches to safely be applied when the proper value is detected, otherwise code during the multi-stage bootloaders will be overwritten when they shouldn't be.
